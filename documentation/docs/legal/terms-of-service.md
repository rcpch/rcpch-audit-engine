!!! important
    **The Terms of Service must be accepted as a condition of use of the Epilepsy12 Platform**

## Key points

You will maintain confidentiality of username and password and assume responsibility for all activities that occur under your username and password. You will verify contents obtained from the site with the official patient medical record before making medical decisions. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) makes no express or implied warranties with regard to the content or reports from the site.

## Acceptance of Terms

The RCPCH ("we", "us" or "our") provides access (the "Site") subject to your acceptance of these Terms. These Terms may be updated by the RCPCH from time to time without prior notice. By accessing, browsing, entering data or otherwise accessing the Site, you become a User and assert that you have read and understand and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If you have any questions about this Disclaimer, please contact us.

## Your Account Obligations

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your username and your chosen password, and for all activities that occur under your username and password. You agree immediately to notify us of any unauthorised use of your username or password or any other breach of security.

## Disclaimers

The medical data and other contents of the Site (“Contents”) were furnished by and entered into the RCPCH site by third parties with the permission of the RCPCH and are presented for informational purposes only. Content contained within or reported by the RCPCH does not supersede the official patient medical record. 

The RCPCH makes no representations, warranties, or assurances as to the accuracy, currency or completeness of the Content provided. You accept the responsibility to verify any contents obtained from the site. Contents should be verified with the official patient medical record before making medical decisions. You should not reply on anything contained on this site to suggest a course of treatment for any medical condition.

Contents do not substitute for review of an individual’s medical record and consultation with a physical or other qualified health provider. Clinics in England should apply the NHS National Data Opt Out process and not submit data from patients who have opted out.

## No warranties

The RCPCH does not make any express or implied warranties, presentations, or endorsements whatsoever (including, but not limited to, warranties of title or non-infringement, or the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose) with regard to the site, the content, any reports provided through the site, and the RCPCH shall not be liable for any cost or damage arising either directly or indirectly from any content or use of the site.

It is solely your responsibility to evaluate the reliability, accuracy, timeliness, completeness or usefulness of all services and content provided through the site. The RCPCH does not warrant that the site will be uninterrupted or error-free or that defect in the site will be corrected. The site and the content made available on the site are provided on an ‘as is’ and ‘as available’ basis.

## Fair Processing Statement

The RCPCH has HSCA Section 251 approval for Epilepsy12 to collect patient identifiable data without explicit patient consent (see references below). This data is processed and reported by the Epilepsy12 project team within the RCPCH with the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) as the Data Controller.  

Full details of fair processing documentation for the collection of patient identifiable information without consent in Health Boards and Trusts in England and Wales will be added to this page prior to the start of the clinical audit data entry phase. Copies of these materials will also be provided to participating Health Boards and Trusts to display in clinic areas and share with their patients and family members. HQIP may approve the sharing of pseudonymised Epilepsy12 data for the purpose of service improvement if stringent data protection policies and arrangements can be demonstrated by requestees and the aims of the service improvement are approved.  

Epilepsy12 data may also be linked to data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). NHS Digital and the NHS Wales Informatics Service may provide HES, PEDW and ONS data to Epilepsy12 in an anonymous format. The linked data would then be analysed by the Epilepsy12 project team at the RCPCH to further help to measure standards of care.  

**If patients or their parents do not wish to have their data submitted to the audit by their hospital, they should instruct their paediatric epilepsy hospital team to not include their data in their annual submission to the Epilepsy12 team. Clinics in England should apply the NHS opt out process and not submit data from patients who have opted out.**
